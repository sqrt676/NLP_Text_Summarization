            "The activities of a number of Hindu nationalist organisations increased in scope after Modi's election as Prime Minister, sometimes with the support of the government. In his first year as prime minister, Modi reduced the amount of money spent by the central government on healthcare. The Modi government launched investigations by the Intelligence Bureau against numerous civil society organisations and foreign non-governmental organisations in the first year of the administration. Over Modi's first term, the government reduced spending on education as share of the budget: over five years, education spending dropped from 0.7% of GDP to 0.5%. There have been several reports of the Modi government to be as an authoritarian conservative government, even due to lack of good opposition. This represented a shift away from the policy of the previous Congress government, which had supported programmes to assist public health goals, including reducing child and maternal mortality rates. Foreign policy played a small role in Modi's election campaign, and did not feature prominently in the BJP's election manifesto. Over the first four years of Modi's premiership, India's GDP grew at an average rate of 7.23%, higher than the rate of 6.39% under the previous government. The RSS provided organisational support to the BJP's electoral campaigns, while the Modi administration appointed a number of individuals affiliated with the RSS to prominent government positions. With respect to the quality of education in government schools, the state ranked below many Indian states. Under Modi, the state government spent less than the national average on education and healthcare. In the later years of Modi's government, Gujarat's economic growth was frequently used as an argument to counter allegations of communalism. Modi was also involved with creating a network of safe houses for individuals wanted by the government, and in raising funds for political refugees and activists. The policy did not increase the government's spending on healthcare, instead emphasising the role of private healthcare organisations. The level of income inequality increased, while an internal government report said that in 2017, unemployment had increased to its highest level in 45 years. As part of the programme, the Indian government began constructing millions of toilets in rural areas and encouraging people to use them. Modi's foreign policy, similarly to that of the preceding Congress government, focused on improving economic ties, security, and regional relations. As Chief Minister, Modi favoured privatisation and small government, which was at odds with the philosophy of the RSS, usually described as anti-privatisation and anti-globalisation. The government also lowered corporate taxes, abolished the wealth tax, increased sales taxes, and reduced customs duties on gold, and jewellery. The social policies of the government generally did not benefit Muslims, Dalits, and Adivasis, and generally increased social inequalities. The state government stated later that 790 Muslims and 254 Hindus were killed. Modi's hardline Hindutva philosophy and the policies adopted by his government continue to draw criticism, and have been seen as evidence of a majoritarian and exclusionary social agenda. Officials in the government, including the Home Minister, defended the conversion programmes.\n"
