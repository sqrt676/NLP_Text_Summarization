            "The PFI's national chairman, Abdul Rehman, was the former national secretary of SIMI, while the organization's state secretary, Abdul Hameed, was SIMI's former state secretary. PFI's state president claimed that this police case was fabricated in a bid to tarnish the organisation's image. The raid resulted in the detaining of at least 100 PFI leaders and activists. In 2012, the organisation conducted protests against alleged use of the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act to detain innocent citizens. On 28 September 2022, the Government of India declared PFI as \"unlawful association\" and banned the organisation for 5 years under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. However, the charges were denied by the organisation, which added that the accusations were fabricated to malign the organisation. Live decently, decently, decently.” After a video of the rally went viral, Alappuzha Police arrested the district president of PFI along with another activist. On 22 September 2022, the National Investigation Agency (NIA) conducted a large-scale raid in the premises of the organization across the country, on charges of terror-funding and money laundering. The Government of India defines PFI as an \"unlawful association\" and has banned the organisation under the Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act. In 2010, the PFI was alleged to have links with the banned Islamic terrorist organisation Students Islamic Movement of India. Following the arrest of these KFD members, Karnataka state government requested the Union government to ban Karnataka Forum for Dignity. The various allegations include connections with various Islamic terrorist groups, possessing arms, kidnapping, murder, intimidation, hate campaigns, rioting, Love Jihad and various acts of religious extremism. The Kerala state government banned the Freedom Parade stating it would jeopardise communal harmony. In 2012, PFI launched a nationwide campaign \"Why the Popular Front\", detailing the alleged false accusations and attempts by mainstream media and other organisations to tarnish its image. The arrested KFD members are Adil, alias Adil Pasha; Athavulla Khan; Ameen, alias Syed Ameen; Rehman, alias Shabbir Rehaman; Kouser, alias Mohammed Kouser; and Safeer Ahmed, alias Safeer. The High Court dismissed the Government's stand, but upheld the ban imposed by the State Government. In November 2017, Kerala Police identified 6 members of PFI who had joined the Islamic State, possibly by moving to Syria using fake passports. In February 2019, at least 1 member of PFI was arrested for murdering Ramalingam, a member of PMK after an argument with some Muslims about conversion activities. The organisation has various wings to cater to different sections of society, including the National Women's Front (NWF) and the Campus Front of India (CFI). Most former leaders of SIMI were either identified with PFI or were holding various portfolios in the organisation. The raids conducted were subsequently termed \"undemocratic\" and \"unconstitutional\" by the organisation. In 2012, the Kerala government informed the Kerala High Court, in an affidavit, that PFI had active involvement in 27 murder cases, mostly of cadres of CPI-M and RSS. In January 2016, 1 member was sentenced to 7 years and 5 members were sentenced to 5 years of prison by National Investigation Agency (NIA).\n"
